//! A simple crate to parse command line arguments. Inspired by its javascript equivalent, commander.js.
//! This crate borrows a lot of syntax from the said library and is easy to get started with. It presents a builder interface to work with and is a wee-bit opinionated on the cli arg parsing workflow.
